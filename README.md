**TipsApp** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Akrm Almsaodi**

Time spent: **+30** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **Required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **Optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **Additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Smart Tip Advisor: Using CoreML to detect product through vision detection using Inceptionv3 Model
* [x] Using SVProgressHUD Pod to improve user experience while processing and detecting captured pics
* [x] Shake the phone to erase current calculations and to enter new bill.
* [x] The app looks right in all screen sizes in Portrait orientation.
* [x] Dark and Light themes
* [x] The ability to dynamically split the bill between multiple payers
* [x] Rounding up/down the share to easily pay the bill
* [x] The option to include/exclude the sales tax in calculating the tip
* [x] The ability to change the 3 default tip percentages in settings
* [x] The ability to change the maximum default number of payers
* [x] Link to external resource to learn more about the appropriate tip percentages

**Note:** I purposely tried to practice in this project as many new concepts as possible such as class extentions, protocols, segues, Cocoapods, closures, CoreML, Vision, OOP, and MVC Model and more! For this reason, the project might look more complicated than it should be :)
